New context : I've been asked to buid a MVP factory where the ideal state vision is 1/customer can self-serves ask to build       
  their own MCP server and be used by the agentic orchestration capabilities. 2/company can add easily old tools (from previous     
  consultancy version) to expose it to the agentic orchestration so It can be used. As this is a product solution we want that to   
  be shipped fast to get customer signals and understand what works best, what can be trowned in the trash, we need an evaluation   
  mechanism. Plan mode : I want you to prepare a brief the best possible way, with a discovery phase where you look at best         
  advanced practices latest evolution of MCP building tool. I want an easy to build/integrate solution. Architecture choice and IT  
  needs to be two-way doors decision as much as possible so we can iterate fast and go back if this is evolving or not the right    
  solution. You can put the doc here : /Users/fabio/Documents/VS-code/agentic-example/mcp-server-factory you can reuse the code     
  from the simple-MVP for the agent logic and LLM traces : /Users/fabio/Documents/VS-code/agentic-example/simple-MVP. I want a      
  clear brief so that claude code will be something state of the art and with minimal errors thanks to no ambiguity
